 abstract = {Our society has been getting more privacy-sensitive. Diverse information is given by users to information and communications technology (ICT) systems such as IC cards benefiting them. The information is stored as so-called big data, and there is concern over privacy violation. Visual information such as images and videos is also considered privacy-sensitive. The growing deployment of surveillance cameras and social network services has caused a privacy problem of information given from various sensors. To protect privacy of subjects presented in visual information, their face or figure is processed by means of pixelization or blurring. As image analysis technologies have made considerable progress, many attempts to automatically process flexible privacy protection have been made since 2000, and utilization of privacy information under some restrictions has been taken into account in recent years. This paper addresses the recent progress of privacy protection for visual information, showing our research projects: PriSurv, Digital Diorama (DD), and Mobile Privacy Protection (MPP). Furthermore, we discuss Harmonized Information Field (HIFI) for appropriate utilization of protected privacy information in a specific area.},
