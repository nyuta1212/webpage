abstract = "The growing popularity of video sharing services such as YouTube enables us to upload and share consumer generated videos (CGVs) easily, resulting in disclosure of the privacy sensitive information (PSI) of persons, i.e., their appearances. Therefore, we need a technique for automatically protecting the privacy in CGVs; however, the main problem is how to determine PSI regions automatically. In this paper, we propose a novel system for automatically protecting the privacy in CGVs. The proposed system tackles the problem of determining PSI regions by using an intended human object detector that detects human objects which the camera person wanted to capture to achieve his/her capture intention. In addition, the proposed system adopts several PSI obscuring methods such as blocking out, blurring and seam carving. We present the results of subjective evaluations of a privacy protected video in terms of the visual quality and acceptability of PSI disclosure, as well as the performance of the intended human object detector."
